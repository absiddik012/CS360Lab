Q1. Given a student class with the members and methods as follows, write a C++ test program (a.k.a. main function) to display names, courseNum and grades of 3 students who have appeared in the examination. Declare the class of name, courseNum. And grade. Create an array of class objects. Read and display the contents of the array.



Ans: 
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
#define MAX 3 

class student {
private:
    char name[30];
    int courseNum;
    int total;
    float perc;

public:
    void getDetails(void); 
    void putDetails(void); 
};

void student::getDetails(void) {
    cout << "Enter name: ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Enter course number: ";
    cin >> courseNum;
    cout << "Enter total marks out of 500: ";
    cin >> total;
    perc = (float)total / 500 * 100;
}

void student::putDetails(void) {
    cout << "Student details:\n";
    cout << "Name:" << name << ", Course Number:" << courseNum << ", Total:" << total << ", Percentage:" << perc << "%\n";
}

int main(void) {
    student students[MAX]; // Array of class objects
    int n = 3; // Number of students

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << "Enter details of student " << i+1 << ":\n";
        students[i].getDetails();
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << "Details of student " << i+1 << ":\n";
        students[i].putDetails();
    }

    return 0;
}
