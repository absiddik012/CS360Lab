Q3. Write the program to check leap year as the first programming exercise, and verify your program by the following cases
a. The input prompt is "Enter a year AD, for example, 1997"
b. Change the prompt so that the example year is 2005
Ans:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int year;

  // Prompt the user to enter a year (example: 1997)
  cout << "Enter a year AD, for example, 1997: ";
  cin >> year;

  // Check if the year is a leap year
  if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
    cout << year << " is a leap year." << endl;
  } else {
    cout << year << " is not a leap year." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
