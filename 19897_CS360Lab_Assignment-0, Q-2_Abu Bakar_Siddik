Q2. Enter the editor and key in the following program. And explain the meanings of each statement.
Ans:
// Program Area calculates the area of a square.
// The user is prompted to enter the number of inches on each
// side. Note that "endl" in line 7 ends in the letter "l", not
// the number one.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
    int inches;
    
    // Prompt the user to enter the number of inches on a side
    cout << "Enter the number of inches on a side "
         << endl;

    // Prompt the user to press the return key
    cout << "Press the return key."
         << endl;

    // Read the user input (inches) from the standard input (keyboard)
    cin >> inches;

    // Display the calculated area
    cout << endl
         << "The area is " << inches * inches << "."
         << endl;

    // Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program
    return 0;
}

Explanation of the statements:

#include <iostream>: This line includes the input/output stream library, which is necessary for input and output operations using cin and cout.

using namespace std;: This line declares that the program is using the std namespace. The std namespace includes the standard C++ library components.

int main () { ... }: This is the main function, where the execution of the program begins. It declares a variable inches to store the user input.

cout << "Enter the number of inches on a side " << endl;: This line outputs a prompt to the console, asking the user to enter the number of inches on a side.

cout << "Press the return key." << endl;: This line outputs a prompt to the console, asking the user to press the return key.

cin >> inches;: This line reads the user input (the number of inches) from the standard input (keyboard) and stores it in the variable inches.

cout << endl << "The area is " << inches * inches << "." << endl;: This line calculates the area of the square (side length squared) and outputs the result along with a message to the console.

return 0;: This line indicates that the program has completed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system. The value 0 conventionally represents successful execution.
